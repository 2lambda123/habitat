AMULET OF SALESH STILL MISSING!

   There has been a major development in the
famous Great Amulet Caper today: the thieves
were found guilty of grand theft magic, and
sentenced to 5 years in The Void.

   Habitat's resident Not-So-Wise-Man, Dada Salesh,
had his Great Amulet of Wonderous Worth stolen
last week.  Salesh, a powerful but clumsy
wizard, attempted to activate a homing-return
spell to retrieve his valuable trinket.  Instead
of recovering the Amulet, the result was the
accidental Porting of the thieves to his home in
the Back-Forty.

   The Amulet is still missing, and all attempts
by  the law to extract information from the
evil-doers were in vain.  It seems that the Amulet
may remain forever lost.
