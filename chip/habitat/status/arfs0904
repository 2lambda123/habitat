 sir jon and I were in front of
 Broadway Bank.  We were playing around
 "talking" trying to figure out the
 graphic characters.  The last thing
 sir jon sent was a series of control
 spaces.  I was just playing around
 with the graphics and received the
 error dump message.

 Last two graphics I saw on the screen
 that I did were control J and K

SUBJ: Lock-up REGION 1310/9:15        
FROM: Frodo B     09/03/87   S#: 71540 
 
 Locked up in Region 1310 at 9:15PM
 Space Usage: 16500-9478=7022

 On screen:  Frodo B
             Hard Hat Sign
             Under Construction -
              Do Not Enter Sign
             Pink Grass
             Trashcan

 Made 3 attempts to pass beyond Do Not
 Enter Sign at left, middle and right
 back of screen.

 F7ed Both signs and got:

   "What's the matter...." message

 Attempted to exit via left and right 
 sides of screen and got back:

   "There is nowhere...." message on 
 both sides.

 Upon attempt to retreat (GO) at bottom
 of the screen, lock up occured without
 my moving (standing at right side 
 facing left) anywhere.  GO kept on
 flashing, I dumped to disk.  When dump
 completed lock-up continued without
 prompt to place Q-disk in drive.  At
 9:30 powered down to get off-line.

At 10:43P.M. on 9/02/87 I attemped to
move out of Machuta's Magic (to the
street). Bonnie and Dragonfish were in
Machuta's. The screen turned black and
the music started as in normal region
transfers. The change was never
completed (I waited 5min.), however. 
Both dump and shift/run stop did not
work so I deceided to power down.
When I logged back on I was a ghost
ouside of Machuta's.

SUBJ: Disk Dump                       
FROM: AGGIE       09/03/87   S#: 68624 
 
 I had to dump my disk tonight due to a
fatal error o . This occurred at 02:08
in the region of Woods St going into
the forest 3 screens south. When I
tried to change screens/regions it
would put me back in the same region no
matter where I went. (To the left , to
the right) After doing this three times
and arriving back in the same region ,
I picked up a note that someone left
behind and then tried to change
screens. It worked, I moved to another
region. I then put the note down and
tried to change screens again and
nothing but a flashing cursor. I waited
10 minutes then tried to dump the disk.
When I did I received the Fatal Error O
message. I was the only person in the
area at the time. There also was a note
and trees.
 
 Do I mail off this dump disk that I
now have?

                          Thanks!

SUBJ: Meeting Outside of HABITAT      
FROM: Greg P      09/04/87   S#: 73409 
 
I would like to propose Private Room
"Turf", if this is ok with those
In-House HabiDeities.

Seriously though, it would be nice to
be able to discuss some of the problems
and soultions we have been
having/finding. :\

How does this sound to everyone else?

                     Count me in!!! There are lots of
                    things that would be so much easier to 
                    discuss while in civilian clothes.

      I am hoping that my Teddy Bear
 which was taken from me in front of my
 very eyes will be returned to me.

      She is on medication and needs it
 4 times a day.

      It has now been several days 
 since she had her medication and I
 fear for her well-being.

1) I sure would like it if we could
create a FORM offline to that met with
the required infomation and upload it
to P2P.  Can we do that and send in the
name of the file?

2) I think that HABITAT should get the
Avatar name from the HABITAT disk so 
that "Identify" won't given a clue
who someone is in HABITAT.

3) I find that having a "sense" of
which direction I am going is VERY
difficult.  Perhaps some sort of 
compass on the screen or at least a
single "N/S/E/W".
