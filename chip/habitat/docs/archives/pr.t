\fBMicroCosm Press Release Draft\fR

.PP
Lucasfilm Ltd., recognized leader in creative entertainment, and Quantum
Computer Services, the fastest growing consumer telecommunications network,
today announced the development of "\fIMicroCosm\fR,"* the window to an
imaginary realm of adventure, mystery and entertainment.

.PP
Designed and developed by the Lucasfilm Games Division in collaboration with
Quantum technical staff, \fIMicroCosm\fR is a multiuser, interactive
simulation of a place that, in many ways, resembles Earth. The software
presents to the player the sights and sounds that their Avatar, or character,
would be experiencing in the \fIMicroCosm\fR, along with interactive controls
to direct the Avatar's actions and movements within the simulation.

.PP
The computer connects the Avatar to the goings on of the rest of the world be
means of real time data communications. Players across the country will have
simultaneous access to the \fIMicroCosm\fR via standard telephone lines,
allowing them to interact in a way not before possible, with real-time, person
to person contact.

.PP
\fIMicroCosm\fR is available exclusively in the Quantum Link {Q-Link} network
for Commodore 64/128 owners, and will be available late this summer.  The
software will be marketed and distributed by Commodore International.

.PP
"\fIMicroCosm\fR is the next generation of network entertainment," said
\l'10', "because we've created sights, sounds and situations for the player to
explore. Some situations approximate those found on Earth, but many
activities, such as quests for adventure and treasure, rely on fantasy and the
imagination of the players.

.PP
"What they do while they're in the \fIMicroCosm\fR is up to them," \l'10'
continued, "but we've thrown in enough adventure and intrigue to make the
\fIMicroCosm\fR a fascinating place to be."
