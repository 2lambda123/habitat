On Habitat namespace:
A Real Problem.... What if I want to play a female Habitat character & My
login is distinctly male (The ID function will tell others this).  Before
Qlink says 'But you can use on of your OTHER Qlink IDs', My wife and two kids
use this disk also (have qlink IDs)... You see? Qlink IDspace is almost all
used up! I think this could have a NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUES! Hey, If I
can't play the character I want on Habitat, why play?  Also, have you ever
played a FRP? Naming is an IMPORTANT thing....  I would NOT want my wisard
named 'BOB76'... 
This is NOT just a philisophical issue with me, it IS gameplay.
Expample: in my adventure, If I choose to dress up like a character/monster...
	I don't want the adventurers to be able to identify me as 'FARMER1'.
	'Hey, MARY56, The dragon's real name is FARMER1.Send him some Mail!'
Example2: MARY44 wants to play a male
	BOB56 enters: 'Hi, who are you?'
	MARY44: 'Ramses II!'
	BOB56 : 'Lets go chase some chics!'
	MARY44: 'sure!' (heh heh, sounds like fun, right??'
	later...
	SUSYQ9: Id's MARY44 (who really cares why?)
	MARY44: "whyed you do that?"
	SUSYq9: 'BOB56, your friend is really a girl!'
	BOB56 feels betrayed
	SUSYq9 has upset MARY44
	MARY44 IS DISCOURAGED
	all involved probably feel that much less like playing Habitat.
	Just because of namespace, the game is HAMPERED...
	YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU WANT! is the message!
	Why does QLINK want to hamper our game??
	Why remove a gameplay element?
	Techical concerns? Thats what Steve Case says..we can debunk this.
	Record-Keeping? bunk. EVEN IF this WAS a problem, there IS a solution.
		(As far as I know, they've never even thought this out)
	Politics? Uncomfort? I feel these are the real seasons...
	They have a naming convention that is inferior to ours and they want
	to force it on OUR universe....
	Lo, and here is my mighty knight BOB77! Give me a break.
	We all lose. Game Over.
	Why has QLINK been so opposed to doing things right in the 1st place?
	(I can go down a list of several examples of requests we have made
	 for stuff that have gone NOWHERE....)
