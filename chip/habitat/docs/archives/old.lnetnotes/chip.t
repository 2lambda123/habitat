The widespread availability of low-cost modems, and in particular the advent
of cheap, mass-produced personal computers with modems and modular jacks built
in (such as the Amiga and maybe the Phillips) suggests a number of interesting
possibilities for multi-player computer games over the phone.

Consider a game like "Empire".  In many ways each player is independent.  If
each started the game on his own machine, but all players shared some common,
mutually agreed upon random number seed to create the world, then each could
play along with only occaisional contact between machines to synchronize their
world states, conduct combat, transmit diplomatic communications, etc.  The
architecture of the communications pattern is problematic, but a single
machine serving as a centralized host seems like the most reasonable solution.

A more grandiose scheme, which I have been thinking about for quite a few
years now, is to have a large (i.e., unbounded) universe with worlds, star
systems, alien races, different types of technology, and well-defined physical
laws.  Players would buy a program in a local store to run on their machine.
Each release copy of the program would have its own serial number to provide
each player with a unique identity from the moment he first boots it up.  All
the extant copies of the program would communicate with a single large
centralized host (like a VAX) over the phone or Telenet or whatever's cheapest
and most convenient.  When the player starts the game, he finds himself in
much the same situation as you do in "Empire": in an expanse of unowned
wilderness, with a relatively primitive state of development and some standard
amount of starting resources.  He would then expand from there, developing his
world industrial base, moving into space, encountering other players and
generally having a grand old time.

The difference between this game and "Empire" is that it would support a much
larger number of players (thousands) in a much larger and more diverse and
open-ended universe.  The universe would have its own abstract existence
independent of the players.  The system administrators (i.e., *us*) could
liven the game up ala D&D by placing alien artifacts, non-player characters
and races, inhabited but unclaimed worlds, and so forth in the universe for
the players to discover and interact with.  In addition, we would be able to
devote the player's whole home machine to information display and control
functions, making the game more interactively fluid and more visually and
aurally stimulating than "Empire".

The difference between this game and similar services offered by Compuserve
and others of its ilk is that we would be dedicated to the game.  We would not
be offering a general purpose time-sharing system.  We would be communicating
with computers running software of our own devising rather than with
terminals.  This means that the level of interaction that we would have to
support would be much more distributed.  Players' computers would correspond
with the host in relatively infrequent (i.e., a few times a day) bursts of
high information density exchanges.  The level of support for dial-ups (i.e.,
the number of ports) would be correspondingly less and the host system could
be optimized for handling the game.  This all means that the level of hardware
resources and consequent support overhead would be less, user connect time
would be much less (per user), and we would therefore (I hope) be able to
charge the players a LOT less than Compuserve or its brethren (I think we'd
produce a more interesting game too!)  We could call it "Lucasnet".

Ideally we would want a game that could be played at a variety of different
levels depending upon player inclination and sophistication: as a
zoom-thru-space shoot'em-up, as a game of exploration, as an economic
simulation, as a diplomacy game; as a serious effort or as a light-hearted
romp; as an occaisional weekend diversion or as a full-time obsession.

I'm sure we're not the first to have this idea, but I think we are uniquely
qualified in terms of our talent, imagination, vision and resources to do it
right and to be successful at it.

Goals:
	- open-ended
	- large-scale
	- low cost to play
	- permits people with varying time commitments to play
	- ability to rejoin if you get wiped out
	- SF/interstellar theme
	- distributed processing on home machines
	- permits different levels of interest and ability
