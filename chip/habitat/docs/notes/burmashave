	This is what I sent to Aric:
Henry the Avatar / Six wives he weds / Divorcing them all / But keeping
their heads /   Habitat

Heads in a suitcase / Heads on a chair / Still he persists / "I've got
nothing to wear!"  /   Habitat

She rests in the sun / She plays in the surf / But all things considered /
There's no place like Turf  /   Habitat

This way / That way / all around town / these teleport fees / are getting me
down!  /  Habitat

Repaint your torso  /  Take off your head /  If this were Kansas /  Then
you would be dead!  /  Habitat

He's got a vampire's head  / He's got King Tut's  / If this isn't Habitat /
I must be nuts! /  Habitat

Head of a dragon /  Head of a duck /  If this isn't Habitat / I'm out of
luck /   Habitat

There once was an avatar / Named Ferderous Snodd / His dog is named Fido /
Now isn't that odd? /  Habitat

You talk in balloons /  You use ESP  /  Isn't it great  / Just how strange
this can be! /  Habitat

Some guns are muderous / Some are quite tame / It helps to remember /
It's only a game /  Habitat

Identification / Can be indiscreet / If the guy you identify / Stomps
on your feet!  /  Habitat

Although personal movements / Have quite a wide range / Have you ever
noticed / You walk kind of strange? /  Habitat

Thousands of Avatars / Inhabit the realms / All talking at once? / The
thought overwhelms! /  Habitat

Crowding a public place / Can be rather rude / If it happened to you /
Then you'd really be / In trouble /  Habitat
