OK gang, here's the first summary report.  The format is a little rough, but
it's quick.  At some point we should figure out how to resolve the official
task list with our long list of minor items and the cumulative bug list.

Format: Number in left-hand column is priority.  Next column to the right is
status: 'T' = testing, 'W' = working on it, ' ' = pending, 'I' = just an idea
right now.  Next comes the initials of the people responsible for the item,
then the item itself.
