			Changes and/or additions to Populopolis
Overall
	Roadblocks... Stores need back doors.  Maybe we should expand downtown
	and add a back alley and other stores.
	Overall I am pleased with the street layout
	Addition of missing teleports!
	We need to create the original Daily Rant issue
	We may want to create one magazine...These should be specific to
	one's interests...running, news, software, etc.
Bob's Bank
	Add another ATM for 2 users?
News Stand
	Region shows newspaper and Magazines... We need Text for them!
	There are only 3 mags and 1 paper there... once gone, they're gone
	Do we want the paper dispenser or should the get create a new paper?
	What about which issue of paper do you have?  Should papers disappear
	after 2-3 weeks?
Hall of Records
	No interior for this region and I am not sure what to put in there
	if we had one.
Furniture store
	Should be locked until users can choose interiors!
	Place CLOSED sign in front!
Cloths store
	2 machines should be stocked with pants, shirts, and jackets
Kelly's bar
	Should have a larger interior.  2-3 regions at least!
	May need to protect items inside from users.
General store
	Need to stock 3 machines inside.  We need to decide what
	items should be inside...
	Suggestions are:  Bag, ball, bottle, flashlight, frisbee,
	gun?, cloths, various knick knacks, paper, knives.
Meeting Hall
	Seems fine to me!
	Does Choke machine work?
Pawn Shop
	Nothing to do here at this time...
	Should the door be locked?
	Do we need to protect the items inside?
New You:
	Add sex_change device to New-you
	Stock Heads into machines
	test Vendo's as background objects!
Other
	Maybe add one special head only found at a culdesac?
