This is the current list of realms under construction.  Please feel free to
add to it as you are inspired.

Populopolis -- The first Avatar village.  Basically generated, needs to be
populated with necessary objects and things to do (and Avatars!).  Has a few
minor glitches that need to be fixed with Twiddle (e.g., all the doors in the
place are locked).

The Road Through The Forest -- An enchanted pathway through the woods.
Consists of branching path that goes off into the scenery, getting weirder the
farther away you travel.  Has a number of surprises embedded in it, notably
the False Oracle.  Currently mapped, and the control files for Riddle are set
up, but the regions themselves need to be generated.

D'nalsi Island -- This is Randy's initial adventure.  Is designed and mapped
out, but needs to have it's data generated.

The Back Forty -- A generic woods area of relatively little complication.
Includes the Not-So-Wise Man's house.  Exists only as a sketch map presently.
Required for Randy's adventure.

The Really Quite Confusing Desert -- This is basically a maze puzzle (it's our
homage to Crowther and Woods).  Sketch map.

The Beach -- Simple social area.  Sketch map.

The Ruins -- The remains of an abandoned city.  Lots of secret passageways and
mysterious twists and turns.  Intended as a setting for treasure hunts and
games of Assassin.  Currently just a sketch map.

Mysterious Magic Castle -- Steve's adventure, coming soon to a computer near
you.  Currently an idea in Steve's head.

Capture The Flag Field -- Sporting area for playing capture the flag.  A
concept only at present.
