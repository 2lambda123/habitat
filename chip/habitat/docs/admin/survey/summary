I locked up when the first question was asked and didn't get to read it all or
respond.  I would, however, rate Habitat Fair for my own (non-game enthusiast)
use and Very Good for the "masses".

Very Good (I'd say Excellent, but there could be some minor improvements.  8)

(I don't know if comments are invited, or just the response to select from, so
I'll risk life and limb by inputting a comment. )

Comment: I think many of us are finding Habitat (in its current stage) to be a
bit boring. This might be reinforced by some of the postings on the Board
meant for that purpose.

With current limitations on what to do, where to go, for the most part one can
travel (seemingly) the entire "world" in 2 hours without really accomplishing
much in a game or adventure sense.

Little surprises would be nice...A found token (location generated at random
from time to time, or a "free" ride on a PORT might be nice...just a little
more than the expected all the time.)

Easy, most of the time.  But sometimes (GETting small objects, F7 for region
#, mostly) the cursor has to be positioned carefully, which could lead to
problems.

In general, Very Easy...however, some of the younger people might find it hard
to use some of the items without any instructions for them (eg. shovel or
chainsaw)

good, but some things are Difficult particularly if you don't understand
what's supposed to be going on.

Easy.  I still have trouble with getting paper to send a letter.
