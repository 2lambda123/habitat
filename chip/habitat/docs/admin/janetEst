Chip, 
   Here are my time estimates for the
Beta Test Prequisite Tasks:

  6 Capacity Monitor - 2 days
                       target 11/14
  7 Rebuild Regionproc - done 11/11
 15 Oracle response - 1 day
                      target 11/17
 16 Bank acct utility - 1 day
                        target 11/16
 18 Text input utility - 1 day
                         target 11/19
 67 Avatar to ghost - done
 68 Online-only ghosts - done
 69 Exclude non-beta testers - done
 40 Msg of the day - 1 day
                     target 11/20 (?)
 72 create avatar w/ token - .5 day
                          target 11/14

 OOPS: Target date for #16 should be
       11/18, not 11/16.

 Note: Question mark on target date for
       #40 is because it is assigned to
       both you and me.
