I have just finished my magnum opus of the week, a very very rough first pass
at a specification document for the minimum object set.  I have copies for
each of you at my desk and I'd like your feedback.  Remind me to give you each
a copy when I come in on Thursday.

Next week is too crazy for them to contemplate doing anything.
We are tentatively planning a meeting after the holidays, with them
flying out the afternoon/evening of Monday, Jan. 6, meeting on Tuesday and
possibly also Wednesday morning, and departing Wednesday afternoon.  This
should be plenty of time to cover the stuff we need to cover.  I plan this
to be strictly a technical working session, so he won't bring Steve Case
with him (unless you want to arrange otherwise -- I'd prefer to keep it
focused on technical issues if possible thought).  He is going to make the
travel arrangements.  He'd like us to make hotel reservations for him
based on our superior knowledge of the local hostelry.  I will get Mary
to work on that.

He's also going to put the C64 communications code on the system tonight
for us to download, with documentation sent by Federal Express tomorrow.
I'll set Randy to snarfing that stuff and starting to work with it.
