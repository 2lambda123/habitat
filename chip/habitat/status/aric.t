	Bureaucrat walk position.... Randy and I both agree that it is fine.

	Spider now holds wand in front of self... I think it was better before,
but it gets the problem off of the list.

	In response to Randy's question, yes, the last  backgammon region 
is now set for the correct reset position.

	I am still feeling under the weather and won't be here long today,
but if there is any urgent habitat work, just let me know.  I met with
Randy before he left and went over his priorities.  Those were mainly getting
those 2 tasks off of the list.
	If there are no tasks, I will be working on Blackhawk this afternoon.
