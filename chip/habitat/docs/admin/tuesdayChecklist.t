MUST be done today:
-------------------
 1. rework database processor to circumvent style/image bug (r)
 2. make furniture work (r+a+c)
 3. verify that new-user customization works (r+a+j+c)
 4. verify that track/sector update works (r+j+c)
 5. make put into pockets/get from pockets work (r+c)
 6. test grenade synchronous/asynchronous (c or r)
 7. test knife synchronous/asynchronous against avatars/objects (c or r)
 8. test throw clamp at horizon (c or r)
 9. test walk clamp at horizon (c or r)
10. test/fix asynchronous head stuff (c or a)
11. implement impassable object (c+r+a)
12. implement supertrap object (c+a)
13. set up avatar talk to echo via host (c)

SHOULD be done today:
---------------------
14. add chore in fake gun asynchronous FAKESHOOT (r or c)
15. fix sound effect in teleport asynchronous ZAPOUT (r+chris)
16. install improved region transition walk sound effect (r+chris)
17. install title music (r+chris)
18. tune event timing in atm withdraw (c)
19. test stereo/tape LOAD/UNLOAD synchronous/asynchronous (c or r)
20. turn on bandwidth reduction (r+j)

SHOULD be done today but are purely host based (so TODAY isn't so imperative):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. fix host database glitches: furniture needs open flags, everything needs
	width (c)
22. turn on collision detection in host (c)

Would be NICE to have today:
----------------------------
23. add asynchronous chore to atm (c or r)
24. handle compass in region entry daemon (c)
25. handle light in region entry/exit daemons (c)
26. handle lights and containers correctly (c)
27. handle security device in entry daemon (c)
28. implement ticket read (c+r)
29. test jukebox (such as it is) (c or r)
