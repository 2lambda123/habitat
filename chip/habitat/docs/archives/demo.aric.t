Subject: CES presentation
	Randy and I talked yesterday about ideas for the CES presentation.
Following are some of the ideas that came out of that discussion...

Purpose of demonstration:

	Show off avatars (variety, capabilities)
	Show off objects (variety, portability, containership...)
	Show off Regions (variety)
	Show off Telecommunications (multiple players, shared host)
	Show off potential for game play

Possible demonstration:

	Begin with avatar at home...

Scene:	Inside of avatar home. Surroundings include; fishtank,
	answering machine, avatar, chair, window.  Answering machine
	is blinking indicating that it has a message.

Action:	Avatar can move things around the house and then later moves to
	answering machine and gets message that FRIENDX is coming over.
	Moments later, doorbell rings and FRIENDX arrives.
	Conversation follows regarding visit to...fountain, park, atm, arcade.
	Avatars decide to travel to arcade.
	Avatars leave house via front door.

Scene:	Front of house.  Surroundings include home, Sun, trees, mailbox.  Flag
	is up on mailbox.

Action:	Avatar opens mailbox and retrieves letter.  Avatar can read contents
	if desired.  Flag lowers on mailbox.
	Avatar realizes that he has no cash, and requests that they stop at
	atm on the way to the arcade.

Scene:	Next region over.  Contains convenient teleport booth, fire hydrant,
	trees.

Action:	Avatars walk to teleport booth and ZAP tm. to side of bank. (we could
	set destination choice with function keys to get us to any region
	desired!)

Scene:	Outside of Bank.  Brick wall in back and ATM attached to wall.

Action	Avatar performs correct mumbo jumbo and Tokens arrive.  Avatars are
	now ready to go to the arcade.

Scene:	Park.  Lots of trees and bushes

Action:	Walk through

Scene:	Arcade.	Contains targets and guns

Action:	Shoot targets together, for points, sound effects.

Scene:	Outside of Cave.  Dark entrance with stonework around edge.

Action:	Decision as to whether to travel inside.

Scene:	Inside of Cave.  Dark background with Rocks on floor and stalagtites
	hanging from roof.  A locked treasure chest lies on the floor here.

Action:	Use target gun to shoot Rocks, Stalagtite, Treasure chest.  When
	the chest is opened (there should also be a key around somewhere)
	a gem will be found inside.  Avatars should decide who gets the gem.

	This is a preliminary layout for a possible demonstration, but many
new objects need to be added in order to give us a larger range of possible
actions.  I think that using a scripting system in important in order to
view all of the possible variations that we can present.
