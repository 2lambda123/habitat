Y'all should find on your desks a copy of the new, improved "extra hump"
Habitat Completeion Schedule.

As per sda's request, this is calculated to get us to Beta-2 the night of
Sunday, August 10 (that is only five days from now).  This schedule does gets
us to Beta-3 two days later than the previous schedule, HOWEVER there is
nothing on this schedule beyond beta-3.  In other words, I did away with the
so called "Release" version in name and pulled everything in under Beta-3.  We
end up completing the overall schedule 5 days earlier than previously planned.
This savings is due to several factors.  Primary among these are our being
ahead of the other schedule on a large number of minor items (which, though
they were minor, added up to a few days) and to a better characterization of
the solution to task #25 that lets me feel confident in planning to spend
couple fewer days on *it*.

This schedule hinges on Quantum getting two things working for us: 1)
integration of the new-user customization protocol and 2) installation of the
version update facility.  The former seems more prone to problems on our end,
so we will attack that one first.  Version update is more complex on the host
end, but I think I can rig some sort of "scaffolding" on the Stratus that
should let us test our end of it regardless of whether Janet gets her part
working.  (We may want to consider adding a new class of "test" object which
simply exists to get sent arbitrary messages and send back arbitrary
responses.)

Even though this is an extra-super-hyper-crunch-mode schedule, Aric and Randy
are fairly lightly loaded with FORMAL tasks.  You guys should be occupying the
rest of your time with world creation, testing, polishing, world creation,
testing, debugging, testing and world creation.

I'm not very good at rah-rah pep talks, but I want you to both know how much I
appreciate your efforts today (which is to say, a lot!).  The rest of the week
is going to be comparably tough, unfortunately.  When it's all over we'll all
have to do something special to celebrate.  In the mean time...let's just do
it and get it over with...
