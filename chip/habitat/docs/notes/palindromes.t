	Leaving your turf in your natural colors
	Is almost as embarrassing as
	Wandering around without your head

	Habitat
	A refuge for those who can't handle
	Reality

	This sign is a lie
	The last sign you saw is true
	The next sign you will see is a lie
	The last sign you saw is a lie
	This sign is true

	(sort of a reality defined by your direction of travel)
