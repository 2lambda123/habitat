/u0/chip/habitat/slur: OBSOLETE

	This directory contains the code for Slur, a Stupid Little Utility for
Riddle.  Riddle was a data massager that has evolved past needing this
utility.  This program translated the binary region contents vectors generated
by Arics original region editor on the C64 into fragments of Riddle code that
could then be processed by Riddle into data that could be uploaded to the host
and turned into region and object entries in the host database.  Fortunately
we no longer have to use it.  These files are left around for historical
interest only.
