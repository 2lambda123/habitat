			Changes and/or additions to Populopolis
Overall
	Roadblocks... Stores need back doors.  Maybe we should expand downtown
	and add a back alley and other stores.
	Addition of missing teleports!
	We need to create the original Daily Rant issue
	We may want to create one magazine...These should be specific to
	one's interests...running, news, software, etc.
Bob's Bank
	Add another ATM for 2 users?
News Stand
	Region shows newspaper and Magazines... We need Text for them!
Hall of Records
	No interior for this region and I am not sure what to put in there
	if we had one.
Furniture store
	Place CLOSED sign in front!
Kelly's bar
	Should have a larger interior.  2-3 regions at least!
	May need to protect items inside from users.
Pawn Shop
	Nothing to do here at this time...
