suits which are so instituted by Licensee with the consent of Licensor
shall be borne solely by Licensee.  As to suits instituted by Licensee

thereof.  Licensor shall have the right to participate and represent
its interests through other counsel of its own choosing.  If Licensor

have any rights against Licensor for damages or other remedy by reason
of Licensor's failure to prosecute any alleged infringements or
imitations by others of the Trademarks, nor by reason of any settlement
to which Licensor might agree, nor by reason of any determination that
Licensor is not the owner of or authorized to make use of the
Trademarks.  If any adverse claim is asserted by any third party with
respect to the Trademarks, Licensee shall have the right to
manufacture, distribute, sell and advertise the Licensed Articles under
any other trademark selected by Licensor with Licensee's approval until
such claim shall have been defeated or withdrawn, or until Licensor
shall have granted to Licensee the right to use another trademark upon
the same terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement.

with any governmental authority, nor take any other action which would
affect the ownership of the Trademarks.  Licensee agrees that it shall
at no time use or authorize the use of any trademark, trade name or
other designation identical with or confusingly similar to
the Trademarks.  Following the expiration of the Term of this
Agreement, Licensor shall be entitled to use and authorize others to
