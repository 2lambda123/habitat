4/17/87 Habitat team meeting w/sda

In order to achieve release into beta test and to revise project completion
plan with better time estimates--

1. confirmed commitment to daily playtesting w/QL at 5:30 (our time)--Aric,
Chip & Randy will let me know of any conflict not allowing them to be on.

2. revised playtest debriefing procedure:  a hard copy bug reporting form
will be created by Chip for distribution to all playtesters.  completed
forms will be turned in to Randy asap (next morning fax from Janet) for him
to maintain tracking system; Chip will review with him Randy's assignment of
disposition daily.  so, rather than the on-line PC debriefings immediately
following a playtest & conference calls after receipt of the tapes to review
the list, Randy will maintain a bug tracking system to, 1) improve efficient
use of everyone's time, 2) improve response to reported bugs, and 3) improve
communication & confidence between us & QL.  I'll discuss this procedure
revision w/Janet & Rob during the scheduled 10:00 conference call Monday
morning.  Assuming their agreement, Cathy & I will review the bug tracking
reports via near-daily conference calls & flag ones needing discussion among
the team.

3. established daily status reports:  Aric & Randy will mail to Chip
(copying each other & sda & me) at the end of each day a brief list of their
accomplishments for the day, notes explaining significant delays in any
tasks, and a list of tasks expected to be undertaken the next day, including
time estimated to complete.  Chip, including his own tasks, will issue a
Habitat daily status summary of accomplishments relative to start of alpha,
start of beta, & estimated time to release.

4. reduced frequency of entire team QL conference calls:  to be scheduled by
Cathy & me as needed, usually at 1:00 our time.  We'll discuss this process
with her on Thursday when she's here.

5. established weekly Habitat team meetings on Friday afternoons, to review
accomplishments of the week & goals for the next.
