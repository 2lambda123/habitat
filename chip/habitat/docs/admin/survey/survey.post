Not much fun - but I'd like to qualify
that a bit by saying that part of the
experience is with other people, and
I was not able to interact with many
other avatars in the time I was able to
be logged in.  I share a computer with
others, so my time was by necessity
rather limited.
.
The POTENTIAL for fun is tremendous...

HabiHermit, RJScott.

Developing the character in the way 
that I`00have permits me a freedom that
most other testers lack -- the freedom
to ignore others and not have them 
think any more of it than "oh...it's
just that old hermit again.  Don't pay
any attention to him.

I`00also enjoy exploring new areas, and
of course finding treasures (or junk 
for hocking) here and there along the
way.

I`00appreciate (but seldom take advantage
of), the additional graphics that can
be utilized.

I enjoy reading the RANT with its
whimsical articles.

The fact that there always seems to be
something to discover makes the game
very appealing to me.  There's apparant-
ly a LOT of pictures crammed onto that
disk, and just when I thought I'd seen
it all, I find something new.
.
I especially like how versatile the
environment is.  There seems to be very
little that can't be done in Habitat.

it's a unique experience, being

even something as simple as opening

I like the user interaction, I like
the fact that you can have an Avatar
made more or less the way you want it,
and can walk around HAB and be
recognised by thouse who know you.
Conversly, if you DONT want to be

Habitat is a precursor of the next phase

Amiga Workbench and others.

What annoys me most about Habitat may
seem petty to you....but I don't like
the way you manipulate the objects in
your pockets.  I hate having to stick
something on the ground, "do it" and
then put something in that...and so on..
if your pockets are full, and you have
a container, a "put" should put said
object in the container....if there is
room.  All the juggling irritates me.

There's really nothing I can actually
say I -dislike-. I do think there could
be a little more efficient control over
one's Avatar. I find it occasionally
annoying to have to go through many
repetitive motions for relatively
simple tasks. Taking an item like a
bag out of pocket, and getting another
item from the bag, can be more time
consuming than traveling several
regions. If this qualifies as a
"dislike", it would probably be my
pet peeve.

I dislike the sluggishness that occurs
when a region gets crowded.  At times,
it can be VERY frustrating waiting for
another avatar's action to be completed.
.
I also dislike the frequency that I find
myself "waiting".  It's annoying that
very few things can occur simultaneous-
ly.
.
Also the fact that some things cannot be
done together at all is irritating.
Eg.:  walking and ESPing, ghosting and
ESPing, ghosting and F7ing, etc.
.
And again, the awkwardness of some of
the avatar's movements is detracting.
Not being able to pass a tree because
it's *slightly* in front of me is a
good example.

Habitat had no set goals for the
characters. Once you've wandered
around the areas, there isn't much
else to do. It also takes a lot of
time to "treasure hunt" and for those
who will be paying to play, it may

The thing I dislike the most is that
it takes so long to go anywhere.
even a simple cross-town walk turns
into a major effort, when it takes
so long to get from one region to
another.  very involved adventures
are out of the question, if I'm paying
8 cents a minute.
.
if the places of interest were closer
together, or if the adventures were
shorter range (so I had to walk only
a dozen regions instead of a hundred),
this wouldn't be a problem.

I would add more quests.....lots of
quests. Quests that are only hinted at.
Quests that you only find out about by
asking the oracle stuff....quests you
stumble on just by being in the right
place at the right time. The "beat the
other avatars to the clue" type of quest
is fun also, but I like the idea of
individual quests too.

Habitat needs a real economy. Opening a
store, stocking it, furnishing it, all
these things need to be priced and set
into procedures. If users are to see Hab
as a real enviornment, they need to have
"tiuchstones" (recognizable situations)
mixed in with the abstracts that make
Hab a world of its own.

way text is edited on the message line.
The cursor keys produce arrows instead
of moving a cursor along the line.
This makes text editing very time

anything impersonal and mechanical that
takes the place of a person.  I think
the thing that bothers me the worst is
the bureaucrats-in-boxes.  I'd rather
send mail to the bureaucrats, and have
them give me a personal answer.

    I would send mail to all Avatars
telling them about the special events
that are going on and how to play them.
    I knew about the wedding cuz the
Bride invited me.... I found a message
about it in the streets.... after the
wedding - I would have missed it
otherwise.
    Yesterday, My friend told be to go
to the vault.  I went but I still don't
know what was going on.....  when you go
public, I think you will find most
people like me...(not very swift).  On
their limited time budget they will have
to be told how to play, so they can
get into it quickly.

I would make the pockets hold more, or
give each avatar a "right" and a "left"
pocket.  This would make it easier to
use the basic exploring necessities
without having to bundle them all up
into a bag and put the bag into your
pocket, only to reverse the process
after changing screens.

The list is endless because the
potential is there for so much.
Hab needs the elements that make life
(or at least movie/fiction life) so much
of a challenge. If hab is too easy, too
obviously a facade, it will fail. If Hab
is a complete system, with goals that
can be reached and projects to do, then
we will see success.

I think the length and frequency of

I would spend playing Habitat, but I
would play it nonetheless.  I think it's

cost me too much to be involved in a

They don't bother ME, but then I know
it's necessary because of the
implementation of Habitat.  However, it
still irks me that sometimes the system
has to try, re-try, and try again to

 I did NOT like Cootie tag..I was lured
 to my fate by a friend..and presented
 with the Rats head as a Wedding Gift.
 NOT funny. It might have been funny on
 Monday..not the day before my HabiWedd.
 It caused me to lose a longstanding
 friend..who *I* tried to lure, in my
 panic. Frankly..it sucked.
:
 The wedding was a riot..the Minister
 didn't show up, the Best Man didn't
 show up and the Maid of Honor didn't
 show up! :DD We got fill-in avatars,
 but the *Judge* CLB wasn't official and
 after the ceremony we noticed he had
 gigantic breasts! Still hysterical over
 that one! :DDD It would have been nice
 to have at least the MINISTER there.
 I have been reassured the HabiWedding
 is legal in the eyes of the Oracle..
:
 Backgammon was a abit strange since the
 board was NOT a Backgammon board!!!!!!!
 It had only 5 points in each section
 instead of six, so we rerolled every
 six on the dice.
:
 The Quest is still ongoing for me..I
 got into the vault and got my next clue
 so..I'll let ya know! :D

 I enjoyed most of the weekend..with the
 exception of Cootie Tag..and the
 Skullhead with his DEATH remark.

Randy's Region Rally: the last clue was
  too difficult.
R & R Weekend Adventure: SOME clue to
  what's going on and how it works would
  be helpful to those who couldn't be
  there Friday night.
Sheriff Election: It could have been
  more elaborate, and probably would
  have been, with more people and in a
  normal (non-testing) situation.
Popustop Grand Opening: It could have

I still don't care for region rallys...
I want more substance to my wandering.
.
The R&R adventure was fun...the puzzles
were simple once you knew the answers..
but finding the answers was tricky!...
well done!
.
I found the poputstop opening a bit
boring...wandering around level after
indentical level was boring...I gave up.

Of the two I was actually involved
in, I enjoyed them both. Although I
participated in a sense, in the 'tag'
game, I didn't see it as particularly
enjoyable.

Randy's Region Rally seemed to lack any-
thing to *do* other than to run around
looking at clues and puzzling over what
they mean.  Thumbs down.
.
R&R's Weekend Adventure was a lot
better.  Besides looking for clues
(which were more straightforward and
comprehendable), there was "stuff" to
find and take and keep and show off. :D
It was solvable within a reasonable time
frame, and the prize was worth it.
Thumbs up.
.
I only participated in the wedding
because someone didn't show up at the
last minute, and I helped out as a
favor. Personally, I find online
weddings to be kinda dumb, but I agree
that for those who like them, Habitat is
an ideal environment.
.
The Popustop grand opening was mildly
interesting, but very appropriate.

The wedding was great!
The Sheriff election was a bust. It
took me forever to find out who won,
not enough people voted.
The PopUStop opening was very
confusing. I never did find out
what the quest was.

 Randy's Rally...I have to admit I
           stayed up nights trying
          to figure this one out .
 Sheriff's Election...Well, what can I
          say? WE WON!! And I got on the
          letter writing list :D
 Wedding...Participated in one. I have
          a cute little wedding picture
          album! That's one thing I
          didn't get for the QWedding..
 Cootie/Tag...I only 'gave' the head up
           on the terms I'd get it back.
          Oh well....
 R&R Rally...If this is the current one,
          I'm still trying!
          Is it fixed yet? :D

The Sheriff's election was fun but not
very practicle at this time. The Sheriff
needs some deputies and duties so
Avatars see's representatives of the law
around.

 The R&R Weekend adventure was fun but
a little too difficult for me... I think
individual adventures like I mentioned
before would be better, although I'd
still keep the group adventures too.

Generally, the adventures I've been
involved in so far were much too
difficult.  I consistently noticed
that there was little if any spirit
of cooperation from other avatars.
It seemed that I was solving these
things on my own, rather than being
part of a group - and that was solely
because it was presented as a
competitive thing rather than a
group activity.  The first person to
find it got a prize... so no one wanted
to tell anyone anything, and it was
a rather unfriendly experience all
the way around.  I wasn't able to
solve either adventure.

necessarily accepted.
I got there to vote on the last day of

Randy's Region Rally was a bit confusing
for some of the clues.. just a tough
quest, that's all!
R&R Weekend Adventure was REALLY 
confusing..but I loved it! I never did
find the Vault until the last day, but,
following hints from others, I still
managed to find 2 keys!! :D
The Wedding was sorta ho-hum.. I was
never much for Q-Weddings and Habi-
Weddings aren't much different..
Sheriff Election: I lost. ;> (But he
voting setup was GREAT!!)

No particular preference - it should be
according to the TYPE of activity.
Some activities are best kept short,
while others should be extended.  And
some people prefer extended ones, while
others have limited time and would like
to complete a one-shot adventure, and
not have to miss out on the end of a
challenge because of time.

I would love to design "puzzle type"

great pleasure from creating them as

Yes. I would create adventure zones.
These areas would be entered at the
players own risk, and would be similar
in character to AD&D structured
adventures. There would be underground
cave/maze adventures, as well as wilder-
ness/forest challenges. There would
also be more contemporary games,
perhaps murder mysteries, or solving
the puzzle of a theft of some rare item.
I believe activities of this sort
would be very attractive to most
players.

There are lots of neat ideas.  The first
one that comes to mind I had thought of
a while ago.  For Halloween, there could
temporarily be a "haunted house" in the
Back 40.  Hidden doors, treasures, clues
to other treasures, monsters, the works.
:)
I think whole new cities should
definitely be developed.
.
Another idea I had was a set of regions=
totally separate from Populopolis.  It
would be a huge spaceship, designed in a
similar fashion to Popustop.  Every
avatar would be a crew member of some
minor degree.  "The Oracle" would be
replaced by "The Captain", and the roles
of Bahia, SPBLives, et al could easily
parallel to the first officers and leut-
entants (sp?) and so forth.
Every month or so could bring a new
"planet" to explore, or they could
return to an old one, or whatever. The
ship would be full of rooms to hang out
in, and recreations, and "weapon con-
soles" to use during any alien attacks.
I could go on and on...  :D
.
This medium is so versatile, that the
possibilities are endless.

I'd especially like to create regions
that duplicate popular rooms in People
Connection, such as Bonnie's Bar and
the Red Dragon Inn.  I think people
would enjoy seeing these places in a
visual way, after having spent so much
time in them...  I would do this with
the cooperation of key users who are
responsible for creating and/or manning
the rooms nightly in PC, so as to get
the best match between the visual and
imagined realities.

anyone who has spent time in PC.

As I indicated previously,
I think that somewhere around 60-70
percent of the members will get the
H disk...and of those, about 50-60
percent min. will become regular
players

Hard to say. I'm limited to mostly PC

the ones I've come to know. Of those, I
would estimate around 90% PG members 
and maybe 60% PC members would become
regular Habitat players.

less than 5 dollars.
If you don't think you can recover the
cost of development from profits made
by people playing the game, then it
probably isn't really worth releasing.
I spent 39 dollars to buy "Might and
Magic". I've now played it at least 90
hours....much less then 8 cents a
minute.

I expect to see it cost $15-20,
but I'd like to see it cost $10,
because I think the interest (and
the profit) is to be made in long-term
use.  a low introductory price says
to the customer that you believe he/she
will use the software, and that you're
not trying to make the money up front.

$5 to $10.  I believe the cost should
cover dup and mailing.  Members will be
paying plus time to access and stay in
Habitat.  I think if the cost of the
disk was higher, not as many would
even try it.
<And knowing alot of members, they'd
just dup the disk and pass it around>

Before this week end I was only testing
it because I had comitted myself to do
so , But Now I am enjoying it more and
I am testing because I want to :) and it
is more fun now that there are more
people here :)
The place was real boring, But I under-
stood why :)
Alpha is a lonely place :)

My last surge of playing occurred
because there was a very interesting
quest in progress.  As I've said before,
it was well-designed and almost
addictive.  I hated to leave it unless
someone else would find the treasure.

I enjoy the challenge of the game. The
interaction of the players (when anyone
happens to be there the same time, 
which has been rare). I love finding 
new "toys" to play with, whether magic, 
heads, or whatever! I love the graphics.
I love the surprises by LFL programmers
(even Cooties!;). Basically, I have not
found much I do NOT like in Habitat. It
is very enjoyable!

made plans for how the guild can help
keep Hab active, I have designed
contests for the Rant to help keep the
other Avatars interested. I want to see
it succeed. I think that Telecom

I have not been in Habitat for quite
a long while.  This is iin NO WAY due to
the Game or the system HABITAT.
It is merely due to My busy seched.
It seems that in the last month a LOT
has happened with THE PHANTASY GUILD and
Q-Link. IT has ment Much more time to
maintain and operate the Guild itself.
Outside of Q-Link I also have a career
that pays my way in life. As Much as I
TRUELY desire the GUILD to have a place
in Habitat. I have not been able to make
enough time to even properly test for
you. I apologize for that.
Also wih the short notice of the
HABITAT WEEKEND I was unable to change
pre set plans. so again I missed an
Excellent oportunity to use this
marvelous new environment. I hope that
as the Holiday Season passes I shal be
able to better arrange my schedual to
allow greater Time for Habitat.
As a Member of the Phantasy Guild I am
even now honing my skills as a
Game Master to prepare for adventuring
in Habitat. The Guild and I myself
have great hopes for HAbitat as a
wonderful RPG environment. I hope that
RPG can and will be a Big part of the
overall Habitat environment, after all
Adventure is the spice to an Avatars
life!

I'm not sure my activity record is
pertinent to this one or not, since I
cannot remember the exact date of my
last Habitat access, but the reason I
have not been active recently was
mentioned in previous notes... the press
of off-line commitments, and not having
ready access to the 64 when I *DID*

Overall the documentationn was ver  well
put togeather, however It might be a
bit better if you could add REGION MAPS
somewhere in the documentation. We all
had fun mapping onn our ownn but it did
take a LOT of time! wich is ok for users
But I though the Idea was to have fun.
I think it would make it easier for NEW
Avatars to find thier way around with
better maps, heckeven the Old Avatars
could still use some decent maps :)

Very helpful, EXCEPT....
It's obvious that some things were
changed, added or discarded after the
manual was written. (Or maybe some of it
just hasn't been put there yet.)
Otherwise, it was much better than most
manuals.

I don't care for the "story type of
manual".  I don't mind reading
documentation of that variety at later
date, but when I first get a piece of
software, I like to see a clinical list
of commands without all the window
dressing.
I think both should be included with
the package.
