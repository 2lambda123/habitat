This is a brief map of the reconstructed Lucasfilm/QuantunLink source file
directories.

c64 -- Source for the Commodore-64 Habitat/Club Caribe frontend.  This
        top-level directory contains headers, machine-generated include files,
        the .mud file for building the C64 disk database, and copies of the
        binaries for the .dat files which resulted.

    c64/Behaviors -- Macross 6502 source for all the position-independent,
        dynamically loaded object behavior code.

    c64/Images -- Macross 6502 source files and binary .cel files for the C64
            object image data, in two sets:
        c64/Images/Heads -- Heads
        c64/Images/Props -- Everything else

    c64/Main -- Macross 6502 source for the main body of the C64 frontend.

    c64/Sounds -- Macross 6502 source for the C64 sound effects data, in three
        sets of files, *.sbb, *.sob and *.spp

stratus -- Undifferentiated mass of PL/1 source for all the backend stuff (not
        including the Ghu utility which is in the 'tools' directory).
        struct_*.incl.pl1 files are essentially equivalent to C typedefs (since
        PL/1 has no type definition facility we hacked around it with include
        files).  *.incld.pl1 files in general are headers of various types.
        class_*.pl1 files are the host parts of the object behaviors.  Main
     	processes are habitat.pl1, habitat_db.pl1, hatchery.pl1, and
        regionproc.pl1.

tools -- Various tools used in the construction of the Habitat databases.
        Except for Ghu, these are C utilities that run under Unix.

    tools/ghu -- PL/1 source for Ghu (Ghod's Handy Utility), a (very) general
        purpose backend database display and tweaking tool.

    tools/griddle -- C source for Griddle and Fred, used to generate region
        data for upload to the host.

    tools/misc -- C source for miscellaneous C64 database fiddling.  Probably
        not interesting.

    tools/muddle -- C source for Muddle and Puddle, used to generate the C64
        object disk image.

    tools/plex --C source for Plex, a 2-dimensional programming language for
        generating complexes of regions.

world -- Region data defining the initial Habitat world.  These were processed
        by various of our tools and uploaded to the host for consumption by Ghu
        and thence into the backend databases.

    world/Realms -- Realms are groups of regions.  These files define the
        relationship (interconnection, etc.) among clusters of thematically
        related regions, as well as the objects to be found inside those
        regions.  These are text files which are ultimately input to Ghu.  Each
        subdirectory is a realm with its related files.

    world/Regions -- These are binary representations of various regions,
        editable with the C64 region editor, Fred.
