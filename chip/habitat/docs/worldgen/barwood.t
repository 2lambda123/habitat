Subject: hal's comments, a reminder
Hal suggested the following:
1.  "Hide a thing".... have someone find it and re-hide it somewhere in
the Universe.  Have them leave a clue.  Finding it is important, and
records are kept, announcements made, etc.  This is a trans-realm game.
2.  Automatons.  Like Big Game Hunting, only hunting snipes or something.
They try to keep away from avatars.  Catching one is a big deal, as they
are somewhat mysterious.  Loch Ness Monster and Abominable Snowman.  Maybe
they leave tracks or something.
3.  Special gates that only allow certain kinds of people in... eg. ones
with fly heads or something.  Maybe not made absolutely clear what the
criteria are before you get there, to keep the mystery up.
4.  Parts/Puzzle.  Like Legos.  Gather the parts to build a thing (like
an H-Bomb).  Find out if people build the bomb and blow up the world,
or destroy the parts so no one else can.... A little morality play.
