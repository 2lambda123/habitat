/u0/chip/habitat/noodl: OBSOLETE

	The files here were the first attempt at implementing Noodl, the
Negligable Overhead Object Description Language, an attempt at designing an
object behavior definition scheme for the Habitat host.  It was quickly
superceded by the host PL/1 code that we have now.  Too bad.  The files here
are of historical interest only.
