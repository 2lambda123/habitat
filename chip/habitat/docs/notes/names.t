These names should be RESERVED.  They should not be made available to outside
players, though they may be made available to insiders.  If any of these names
are already taken by outsiders, let us know right away, so we can change the
manual.

	Arnquirt	Cosmo		Fledmich	Planterret
	Berford		Dredmitch	Fredrhackh	Platorius
	Blattwork	Falrouche	Gerfingle	Rosetta
	Bleenquit	Fendersneek	Grizelda	RubinSnide
	Blumbeach	Ferdinand	Jeanette	Zapmeister
	Columbius	Figwash		Phlebitus

These names need not be reserved, but should be investigated.  They are
mentioned in the manual in contexts where having persons use them should not
result in any problems.  However, it might be better if they were taken by
insiders (some of them already are, I know).
