	These are the problems we are having or have had with Quantum or with
Quantum's systems that have resulted in delays of greater or lesser
magnitude.  These do not include any unfinished tasks that are a direct part
of the Habitat project itself.  Those are discussed in the separate task
status document.

	- It took a long, long time for the Telenet link to be established
that enables us to work directly with their system.  I requested this during
the first week in April.  It was not working until the first week in May.

	- The Telenet link has flaked out and been unavailable a couple of
times due to changes (that broke things) at their end.  This cost an odd day
of host software work from time to time.

	- On various occasions, important directories and files were moved
around on their system without notice, causing a couple of lost evenings of
work (since we had to wait until the next day to find out what had happened).

	- Though we have tried numerous different strategies, we have not been
able to establish a means by which the Stratus can reliably receive data files
over the phone line, necessitating variously: hand entry of data files, hand
correction of corrupted data (on occasions when we "almost" got it
transmitted), and transmission of data via the extraordinarily high-tech
channel consisting of a magtape in a Federal Express packet.  This has caused
numerous delays in getting required data to them.  In addition, we would be
much more productive if we could use our considerably more powerful local
systems to edit textfiles here and upload them, instead of having to use the
grody Stratus line editor (which is the only editor that works over Telenet).

	- Though we understand that it is basically ready, we still lack
access to and documentation for "Twiddle", a program Janet has been developing
that will allow us to manipulate the Habitat region database ourselves.  This
means that even the most trivial alteration to the state of the world requires
tens of minutes at best and at worst a round of telephone tag lasting hours or
days.

	- Heavy usage of the production Q-Link system has recently usurped the
development Stratus, making it unavailable for our purposes during the late
afternoon and evening.  This is costing us heavily right now.
