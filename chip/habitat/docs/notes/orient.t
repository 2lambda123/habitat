	ORIENTATION BYTE

	0b00000001	; screen orientation.... face left or face right
	0b00000010	; facing forward or back (avatar only)
	0b00000100	; currently not used.  Some objects in the world have
			; this bit set and some don't. I was considering using
			; this to signify objects that the pointer ignores.
	0b01111000	; choice of one of 16 patterns or commodore colors
	0b10000000	; decides between pattern or color. If set, use color



	Any other questions, just buzz.
