'The quest for the Great Horn of the Green Bleem' is now called:
'The quest for the Tome of Wealth and Fame'

The tome is the graphic style #7 of book.
100% of the special case code is on the host.
The Oracle will arbitrate prize awards.

It works like this:
If you are holding the tome and 'do' it, you will recieve
several pages of text (congratulations, instructions & a list of names.)
The beahviour code will check to see if your name is on the list,
if it IS NOT, it will add you name TO the list. One of the instructions
is to inform the Oracle that you found the tablet. The Oracle/super-user
must then make certain that the rules have been adhered to, then will
award the cash bonus (and mail WEEKLYRANT with username?).



>>>>> The Tome of Wealth and Fame <<<<<

IMPORTANT: Please read ALL of the
stones in this tablet.

CONGRATULATIONS! You have completed the
first step in the Quest for:
>>>>> The Tome of Wealth and Fame <<<<<

Upon successful completion of the
quest, you will receive $5000. Also, 
for NO EXTRA CHARGE, you will have your
name engraved in these tablets for all
ETERNITY so treasure seekers will know
that YOU have joined the ranks of:
Master Adventurers.
To collect your prize you must:
1) READ ALL of this tablet
2) HIDE them in a place that will make
    them hard to find.
3) SHOW them to NO ONE.
4) HIDE them NOT in a turf.
5) When they are hidden, seek an Oracle
    and say "Willy Willy Nilly Billy".

  The Oracle will decide how well you
obeyed the rules & how well you hid the
tome. To collect your prize you MUST
hide it well enough that no one ELSE
finds it before the Oracle can respond.

Part 1:
Oracle speaketh:
Attention!

Attention!

Ahem-----

Welcome to:
The First Habitat Region Rally!

First find the tracks of a silly YikYak.
It lives in the 40,
that we call 'The Back'.

It wears pointy shoes, 
and walks very strange.
Not forward or sideways,
when it roams on it's range.

To find The Back-40,
(If you are new),
find Randy Rd cross.
Walk into the blue.

The first part of the clue
to the answer, you'll find,
If you read off the digits
and divide it by nine.

Good Luck

part 2:

False clue At 36 Wrong Way (how appropriate):

A vending machine: for 1 token a piece
of paper (class_book)

Welcome to my humble home,
Want some clues? I'll give you some:

The street you are now give you a clue,
Where to go next,and what you should do.

You you feel glad?
Should you rejoice?
Does it help you to know?
That others made this choice?

*************************
Real clue At 47 Foon Ave:

A vedning machine:
	Paper (book), for 1 token

How about a picnic at 'The Beach'?
It'll put those riches in your reach.

'The Beach' can be found This Way...
Look for the place where stars shine.
and go to a star, just yours, not mine.

Find the Hut of the Yabba-Dabba-Flit
Once for each rock in it's pit,
Count to the Left as you flee.
Write this down, its confusing you see.

Down then, and Right for each blade
Count them, don't rest in their shade.
Number the trees, both dead & alive.
The Sign in the sky is really no jive.

------------------------------------
PART 3:

At the desert heart: (RQCD)

A vendo:
	1 token ; warning book
		; clue book

Warning book:
Welcome to the Really Quite Confusing Desert.

ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK.

No known maps exist.

Avatars that have weak hearts or get
disoriented easily should not enter
without proper equipment.


STARE WARS: act IV page 99

LUNK: "In the name of all thats RIGHT,
the rebellion will win"

DIRTH: "I will put DOWN your puny
'rebellion' with the wave of my hand!"
(DIRTH gestures, and LUNK starts grasping
his throat with his RIGHT hand then falls
DOWN to the ground writhing in pain.)

LUNK, gestures with his LEFT hand and
sends a sofa flying into DIRTH, thus
releasing LUNK.

LUNK:"UP with the rebellion!" and
LUNK escapes by using his laser-
chainsaw to cut the power.

note to the scriptwriter: is this
the RIGHT way to get out of this
scene? Fondly: the producers.

Part 4:

at region 5020:

a large sign:

	D i g i t s   A r e
	 a  T e l e p o r t

part 5:

False Endgame region : Port # 4765499

Teleport:
Sign (Shingle):

"Abandon Hope.
 ^
<?>
 v"

this region points to itself in *ALL*
directions.

***************************************

Real Endgame region : Port # 476549923

Teleport,
Button,
Sign on wall:
"Push button!
     v
     v
     v
     v"

Button sends message to host, text
balloon comes back:
"Congratulations, you have won
$xxxxx tokens!"
"Contest limited to one member per disk."

I think the token amount should be
$1000 and be decreased by $100
tokens/finder (minimum $100).

if you 'do' it again:
"Sorry, you can only win once."
