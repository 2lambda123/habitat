/u0/chip/habitat/looi: OBJECT

	This directory contains the code for Looi, the Low Overhead Object
Interpreter.  This was originally a design for a low overhead object behavior
lookup and dispatch processor for the Habitat host system.  It was superceded
by the Stratus PL/1 stuff that we currently use.  The files here are of
historical interest only.
