Milestones/deliverables for MicroCosm project

Note: the notation "(L->Q)" means a deliverable that Lucasfilm delivers to
Quantum; the notation "(Q->L)" means a deliverable that Quantum delivers to
Lucasfilm; the notation "(joint)" means a deliverable that consists of two
interdependent components that Lucasfilm and Quantum exchange with each other;
the notation "C64" refers to the Commodore 64 computer.

Dec 15	Graphics tools -- completion of software to enable an artist/animator
				to design and compose imagery and animation of
				avatars and objects.
		(L->Q): videotape demonstration of the graphics tools in
			action, showing what the software does and how it is
			used.
	Graphics driver -- software to render imagery and animate avatars and
				objects complete as a package of 'standalone'
				routines that are fully functional but not
				integrated into any finished system.
		(L->Q): videotape demonstration of the animation driver in
			action, showing its speed and approximate capabilities
			in isolation.
	Communications routines -- existing C64 software for communications
				with the Q-Link host is available for
				incorporation into LFL generated systems.
		(Q->L): source code for C64 routines with accompanying
			documentation (in machine-readable form).

Jan 15	Primitive communications -- C64 able to exchange trivial messages with
				the host system.
		(joint): LFL C64 system is able to call up Q-Link and initiate
			communications under program control; the C64 can send
			messages to the host which the host echoes; the host
			can in turn send messages to the C64 which the C64
			echoes.
	Host development system -- Host system is available to LFL programmers
				for programming, testing and installation of
				object modeling software in the developmental
				host database.
		(Q->L): login id's, phone numbers, and any other information
			and measures necessary so that LFL programmers can
			remotely access Quantum's development system for
			software development use.
	Object definitions -- the basic set of objects which constitutes the
				MicroCosm fantasy experience is defined.
		(L->Q): definition document listing the contents of the basic
			object set including a description of the name,
			appearance, purpose and behavior of each object that
			Lucasfilm intends to implement as part of this
			project.

Feb 15	Primitive host database processor -- the object-oriented behavior
				invocation mechanism in the host is
				functional.
		(Q->L): LFL C64 is able to call up Q-Link and initiate
			communications with the MicroCosm host database
			processor; it is further able to send requests to
			dummy test objects and receive appropriate responses
			via the object/message protocols defined in the system
			specifications; the database is made available on the
			Quantum development system for LFL programmers to
			install and test object modeling software.
	Partial object artwork -- the first batch of imagery for displaying
				objects and scenes on the C64 screen.
		(L->Q):	videotape and possibly screen photographs of artwork
			and animation on the screen of the C64 portraying
			avatars and many of the objects in the basic object
			set.

Mar 15	Graphics and animation -- the graphics and animation subsystem of the
				C64 MicroCosm implementation is finished to a
				first approximation (i.e., it works though
				there may still be a few bugs in the system).
		(L->Q): videotape of graphics and animation routines being put
			through their paces on the C64.
	More artwork -- further imagery for objects and scenes on the C64
				screen.
		(L->Q): videotape and/or screen photographs of artwork and
			animation on the C64 screen.
	Some functional objects -- the first batch of objects (including both
				C64 and host resident components) is working.
		(L->Q): videotape demonstrating player interaction with
			objects involving the C64 acting in concert with the
			host.

Apr 15	Finished host database processor -- the baseline host system software
				is completed.
		(Q->L): complete host database system is available to LFL
			programmers for final testing.
	Rest of objects -- more or less complete object set is working.
		(L->Q): videotape demonstrating player interaction with the
			MicroCosm system; bootable C64 diskette containing
			complete pre-release C64 portion of system; complete
			pre-release host database installed on Quantum's
			development machine.

May 15	System integration -- complete beta-testable system is finished.
		(L->Q): bootable C64 diskette containing beta-release of C64
			portion of system; host portion of system installed on
			host machine.
	Preliminary player documentation -- documentation necessary for
				players	to use the beta-release C64 MicroCosm
				system on Q-Link.
		(L->Q): text and illustrations for preliminary MicroCosm
			player's manual.
	Beta-test release -- release of complete system to a limited and
				carefully selected set of players for purposes
				of in situ testing and debugging.
		(Q->L): list of players participating in beta-test use of
			MicroCosm (these players have received diskettes of
			the beta-release C64 system software, documentation,
			and access to the beta-release host system); player
			feedback channels must be provided and LFL programmers
			should have direct access to the player feedback
			information so received in order to proceed with
			debugging and tuning.

Jun 15	Complete system integration -- complete set of objects entirely
				functional and full system operating smoothly.
		(L->Q): diskette containing most up-to-date version of C64
			system and matching host system software installed in
			host.
	Avatar customization package -- standalone C64 program to enable a
				player to interactively customize the
				appearance and properties of his MicroCosm
				avatar.
		(L->Q): diskette containing C64 program.
	Turf customization package -- standalone C64 program to enable a
				player to interactively customize the content
				and layout of his turf region(s) in the
				MicroCosm world.
		(L->Q): diskette containing C64 program.

Jul 15	Final player documentation -- documentation necessary for players to
				use the final release of the C64 MicroCosm
				system on Q-Link.
		(L->Q): text and illustrations for the release edition of the
			MicroCosm player's manual.
	Final system software -- the absolute last (until the next rev) most
				up to date, most debugged and most finely
				tuned version of the software.
		(L->Q): C64 diskette containing full C64 software package plus
			final release object set installed on Q-Link host.
	Public release --
		(Q->L): system made available to paying customers on Q-Link.

Aug 15	Final reports and documentation -- the last bit of paperwork and
				documentation before the system can truly
				said to be finished.
		(joint): Quantum and LFL each provide a final report detailing
			the final disposition of the project.
