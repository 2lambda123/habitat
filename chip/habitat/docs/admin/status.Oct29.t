Here's where we are as of Wednesday, Oct. 29

Randy is struggling with the communications software.  He's encountering lots
of problems (nothing in particular, it's just one of *those* days) and
anticipates having something working in a day or two.

Randy has finished design for the new downtown and the road rally.  The
regions and objects for these still need to be uploaded to the host.  He is
currently being distracted from other world generation tasks by the 1200 baud
communications problems.  Once the communications stuff is knocked away he'll
resume work on the Capture the Flag arena and the stock market game.

Aric has finished his parts of the new downtown as well as the road thru the
woods (yes, it's really done this time).  These new regions await uploading to
the host.  He's still working on design stuff for Chicago Kingpin.  Mostly he
has been preoccupied with integrating some new artwork we've gotten from Gary
and with preliminary development work on Reno (the realm editor).

Janet is still working on the database problems.  As yet few leads as to what
is going wrong.  Hopefully there will be better news tomorrow.  We also have
agreed to have an extended conversation when I get in tomorrow to cover the
second phase of the capacity monitoring software.

I am working on design for the geographic master plan and for the automatic
apartment generator, compiling documentary materials for the beta release (I
created a really nifty keypad overlay using MacDraw, among other things), and
handling ongoing project status documentation.  If I have time I'm also going
to try to make the design for Machiavelli a little more concrete.
